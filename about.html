            <p>I'm JWBstuhr. I enjoy coding, but I'm not the best at it.
                <br>The most I can do is advanced block.ly and pretty basic HTML/CSS/JS.
                <br>I could also be summarized as "decent" with Lua.
                <br>I don't care much for TV, but if I had to pick a show I like it'd be Doctor Who.
                <br>As for movies, I like the Back to the Future trilogy. <br>Honestly I prefer YouTube to both of these.
